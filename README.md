# Kernel-V_v0.1: Next Steps After Bootstrapping

Wohoooo!!! My kernel boots, enters protected mode, and prints hi to me on the screen. 

## Immediate Next Steps: Make Your Kernel Developer-Friendly

Before moving to memory management or multitasking, add features that make further kernel development much easier and more enjoyable.

---

## 1. Console Enhancements

**Goal:** Make it easy to print debug/info messages to the screenâ€”your main "window" into the kernel as you develop.

- [ ] Implement a `print_string` function that prints C strings to the VGA text buffer at `0xb8000`.
- [ ] Support newlines (`\n`) and simple cursor movement.
- [ ] (Optional but recommended) Add text color support (foreground/background).
- [ ] (Super bonus) Implement screen scrolling when the bottom is reached.

---

## 2. Panic and Assertion Handler

**Goal:** Make it clear when the kernel hits a critical error.

- [ ] Write a `panic(const char* msg)` function that prints an error in a distinct color (e.g., red text), then halts the system.
- [ ] Replace early kernel errors or unexpected states with calls to `panic()`.

## 3. Quick Refactor

**Goal:** Keep the codebase clean as it grows.

- [ ] Move hardware/architecture-specific code (VGA, entry ASM, GDT/IDT setup) to their own folders/modules (e.g., `arch/x86/`, `drivers/`, etc.).
- [ ] Document new functions and modules with comments.

---

## 4. Resume the Main Roadmap

When the above are done, move on to the next planned phase:

- [ ] **Phase 2: Memory Management**
  - Parse the BIOS/bootloader memory map (E820).
  - Implement a physical memory allocator (e.g., bitmap).
  - Set up basic paging and kernel heap.

## ðŸ““ Why These Steps?

- **Reliable screen output** is critical for debugging every subsystem you build next (memory, interrupts, tasks, filesystems).
- **Panic handling** makes it easy to spot bugs and track down crashes, even before you have serial or GDB working.
- **A clean codebase** will save you time and headaches as the project gets bigger.
